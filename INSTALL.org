Clone or download the repo.  On the Mac, cloning requires the command
line developer tools.

In the repo, bin/install-nix.sh.

Start a new shell.

- In the directory. `nix-shell`.  If prompted install the command line
  developer tools and rerun `nix-shell`.

sysdo disksetup

- Ignore any transient error about `apfs.util -B...` as long as the
  command completes successfully.

sysdo bootstrap [host] # May obviate the need for disksetup as it is included.

Bootstrap twice if Homebrew was not installed, but the installer
installed it. That will load the Homebrew packages as well.

PragmataPro must be manually installed.

Doom Emacs is also manually cloned into ~~/.emacs.d~ for now.
