Except for this README and [[file:node-packages.json::\[][node-packages.json]], the files in this directory were generated by running:

#+begin_src shell
nix-shell -p nodePackages.node2nix --command \
    "node2nix -i ./node-packages.json -o node-packages.nix --nodejs-16"
#+end_src

See [[https://code-notes.jhuizy.com/add-custom-npm-to-home-manager/][Adding custom NPM program to home-manager]] for details on how this was added to my configuration.  The one change I had to make was to change

#+begin_src nix
  extraNodePackages = import ./node/default.nix { };
#+end_src

to

#+begin_src nix
  extraNodePackages = import ./node/default.nix { inherit pkgs; };
#+end_src

in order to avoid the following error

<#+begin_example
error: cannot look up '<nixpkgs>' in pure evaluation mode (use '--impure' to override)
#+end_example

while evaluating the attribute ~bash-language-server~.
